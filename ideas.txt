Make the search button nicer, maybe even do a normal dynamic search bar but I don't want to use too many API calls.
Logout button could be a real button and in the upper right.
Maybe Create New List becomes a button with a popup with a text box and an add button.
Better colors, probably want a non-white background.
When ranking, have logout in upper right as button still but make back a button with an arrow.
Figure out a way to make the list display look nicer.
The row of the dropdown and buttons might end up feeling uglier, probably want to come up with a better UI for that.
DONE: Should be able to change the posters of movies
Way to reset rankings
Maybe integrate top directors and actors - issue: API being used doesn't have this incorporated
DONE: Need to updates search.js so imdb id search does the same stuff as the normal search.
DONE: Smart ranking
DONE: Be able to make non-movie lists. Idea, on top of search have a way to add custom items.
Dropdown for ranking type
DONE Ranking option for "newest", selecting the movie with fewest rankings
DONE Replace rank top with just fetching where winning percents over .9 or something? Then do iterative deepening.
Rename list
DONE Base added wins and losses on total number of movies, like 10% rounded up or something, so in a list of 91 items, each item has 10 wins and losses added to its totals upon ranking.
Stop doing the top percentage thing if not doing top ranking. Also delete those print messages (this part is done).
Smart rank has an error, if A > B, and D > E, C > D, and B > C, A > E isn't entered. Scared to fix this becauuse I don't want to cause a bug and have to restart everything. It also might add more runtime than is helpful. But if I ranked E > A then it causes disaster.
Find the cause of the TypeError: Network Error messages I frequently get in the console.
