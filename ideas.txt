Make the search button nicer, maybe even do a normal dynamic search bar but I don't want to use too many API calls.
Logout button could be a real button and in the upper right.
Maybe Create New List becomes a button with a popup with a text box and an add button.
Better colors, probably want a non-white background.
When ranking, have logout in upper right as button still but make back a button with an arrow.
Figure out a way to make the list display look nicer.
The row of the dropdown and buttons might end up feeling uglier, probably want to come up with a better UI for that.
DONE: Should be able to change the posters of movies
Way to reset rankings
Maybe integrate top directors and actors - issue: API being used doesn't have this incorporated
DONE: Need to updates search.js so imdb id search does the same stuff as the normal search.
DONE: Smart ranking
DONE: Be able to make non-movie lists. Idea, on top of search have a way to add custom items.
